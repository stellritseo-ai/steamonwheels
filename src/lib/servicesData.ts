      "North Carolina's Piedmont region features a unique combination of high summer humidity, dense pine pollen in the spring, and heavy iron-rich red clay.

Our soft washing uses low pressure equivalent to a garden hose, ensuring water flows gently downward naturally without penetrating laps." },
      { q: "How long does a soft wash house washing last in North Carolina?", a: "Because our soft wash solution eradicates the organic root spores rather than just blowing off surface grime, the clean typically lasts 12 to 24 months—up to 4 times longer than pressure washing alone." },

      "North Carolina is famous for iron-oxide rich red clay soil. During construction, landscaping, or wet weather, red clay gets tracked onto driveways where it binds chemically into the concrete pores, leaving stubborn orange-red stains that standard hose water cannot remove.",
      "Additionally, parked vehicles deposit engine oil, transmission fluid, and brake dust that bake into driveway surfaces under the Carolina sun.",
      "Steam On Wheels employs specialized acid and alkaline chemical spot treatments engineered specifically to dissolve red clay iron bonds and emulsify petroleum grease, followed by 4,000 PSI rotary surface cleaning for an immaculate transformation."

    faqs: [
      { q: "Can you completely remove old motor oil stains from concrete?", a: "While concrete is porous and oil can soak deep if left for years, our hot-water power washing and commercial enzymatic degreasers can dramatically lighten or completely remove most oil stains, vastly improving appearance." },
      { q: "How do you remove North Carolina red clay stains?", a: "Red clay stains are caused by iron oxide. Standard pressure washing only pushes it deeper. We apply specialized chemical reduction cleaners that break the iron bonds, allowing the red pigment to rinse away completely." },
      { q: "Will pressure washing damage interlocking pavers?", a: "No. We calibrate the pressure and nozzle angle to clean paver tops without displacing the structural bedding sand underneath." },
      { q: "How long does a typical 2-car driveway cleaning take?", a: "A standard 2 to 3-car residential driveway typically takes between 1.5 to 2.5 hours, including pre-treatment, rotary cleaning, and final washdown." }
